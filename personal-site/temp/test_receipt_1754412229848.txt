    TEST RECEIPT FOR V 1.0 GALLERY
================================

August 10, 2025

This is a longer test receipt to verify
the thermal printer can handle extended
receipts for the Song Swap gallery.

The receipt should be approximately
3 inches long when printed on the
thermal printer paper.

================================
    ADDITIONAL TEST CONTENT
================================

Testing line spacing and formatting
to ensure the receipt looks good
when printed on thermal paper.

This section adds more content to
make the receipt longer as requested.

Thank you for testing the thermal
printer functionality!
